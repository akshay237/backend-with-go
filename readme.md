## Backend With Go
* In this repo we will design, develop and deploy a backend service in go with postgresql, Kubernetes and GRPC.
* This is a backend web service for a simple bank. It will provide APIs to do following:
    ** Create and manage bank accounts.
    ** Record all balance changes to each of the accounts.
    ** Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts.
